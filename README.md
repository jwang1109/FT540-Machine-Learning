# FT540-Machine-Learning


This repository showcases my work and dedication to the FT540 machine learning course during my third semester at Duke.

Through this course, I've taken a deep dive into the machine learning world. Topics incluing statistical learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning are covered in this course.
At the meantime, I also honed my programming skills in Python.
